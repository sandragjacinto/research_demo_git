Intro

Face research literature has outlined that the most relevant information is located in the upper part of the face, which triggers the largest brain electrical signal (e.g. N170). However several studies have shown that the human visual perception displays a low visual field (LVF) advantage. Zerouali et al. (2013) showed that fixating the top of a face elicits the highest N170, whether the face is presented upright or inverted. Suggesting that the upper-fixation bias is a consequence of LVF advantage.


Now it's my time to work on the intro and I'm adding this information.
