To follow-up, EEG and eye-tracking measurements were recorded, while participants viewed face-photographs, face-like phase-scrambled images and face-like checkerboards. 
ERPs were averaged by gaze location. We observed an optimal fixation position located on the upper-visual field, with N170 decreasing amplitude from the upper to the lower fixations. 
Such results suggest that N170 amplitude modulations arise from a retinotopic visual setting enhancing visual information located in the LVF of facial and non-facial stimuli.}
